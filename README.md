# Chatbot Project

This is a simple **Chatbot UI** built with **React** (using a lightweight version from `supersimpledev`).  
It shows a basic conversation between a **user** and a **robot**, including images and text.

2. **Component** = a way to create our own HTML elements.
3. **Started** the Chatbot Project.
4. **Split** the chatbot into smaller components: `<ChatInput>` and `<ChatMessage>`.
5. **Props** = make components **reusable**.
6. **Destructuring** and using the **Guard Operator (`&&`)**.
7. **Code cleanup** for better readability.
8. **Created** the main `<App>` component.
